# Quixote API: Descriptors

* [Back to overview README](../README.md)
* [Back to API overview](api.md)

Descriptors are the most important concept in Quixote. They're used with [`QElement.assert()`](QElement.md#elementassert). Each descriptor represents some piece of styling information, such as an element's width or the height of the page.

Using `QElement.assert()`, descriptors can be compared to hard-coded values, like this:

```javascript
header.assert({
  height: 30      // the header is 30px tall
});
```

They can also be compared to other descriptors, like this:

```javascript
header.assert({
  width: frame.viewport().width     // the header's width is the same as the viewport's width
});
```

Many descriptors have additional methods that allow you to refine your comparisons. For example, `height` is a [`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md). It has methods like [`times()`](SizeDescriptor.md#descriptortimes):

```javascript
header.assert({
  height: logo.height.times(2)    // the header is twice as tall as the logo
});
```

With descriptors, you can make relative comparisons and avoid hardcoding values. This is one of Quixote's unique benefitsâ€”be sure to try it!

**Compatibility Note:** We make every effort to ensure that descriptors work identically across browsers. If you discover a cross-browser incompatibility that doesn't correspond to an actual, visible difference, please file an issue.

**Pixel Rounding Note:** Browsers handle pixel rounding in different ways. We consider pixel values to be the same if they're within 0.5px of each other. If you have rounding errors that are *greater* than 0.5px, make sure your test browsers are set to a zoom level of 100%. Zooming can exaggerate rounding errors.


## Descriptor Catalog

The following descriptors are available:


### Element Rendering

```
Stability: 1 - Experimental
```

A descriptor for checking whether an element is rendered is available on [`QElement`](QElement.md) instances. This descriptor checks that the element is attached to the DOM and that the display:none property is not set. Note that there are many situations in which a rendered element could still be invisible to the user.

* `element.rendered (`[`ElementRendered`](ElementRendered.md)`)` Whether the element is rendered.


### Element Positions and Sizes

```
Stability: 2 - Unstable
```

Descriptors for the position and size of an element are available on [`QElement`](QElement.md) instances. The values of these descriptors include padding and borders (if any), but not margins.  

* `element.top (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The top edge of the element.
* `element.right (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The right edge of the element.
* `element.bottom (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The bottom edge of the element.
* `element.left (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The left edge of the element.
* `element.center (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Horizontal center: midway between the right and left edges.
* `element.middle (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Vertical middle: midway between the top and bottom edges.
* `element.width (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Width of the element.
* `element.height (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Height of the element.

Example: "The logo matches the height of the navbar and is aligned to its right edge."

```javascript
logo.assert({
  height: navbar.height,    // the logo height is equal to the navbar height
  right: navbar.right       // the logo's right edge is the same as the navbar's right edge
});
```


### Viewport Positions and Sizes

```
Stability: 1 - Experimental
```

Descriptors for the position and size of the viewport are available on [`QFrame.viewport()`](QFrame.md#frameviewport). The viewport is the part of the webpage that's visible in the test frame, not including scrollbars. By comparing element positions and sizes to viewport descriptors, you can make assertions about what's visible to the user.

* `viewport.top (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The highest visible part of the page.
* `viewport.right (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The rightmost visible part of the page.
* `viewport.bottom (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The lowest visible part of the page.
* `viewport.left (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The leftmost visible part of the page.
* `viewport.center (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Horizontal center: midway between right and left.
* `viewport.middle (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Vertical middle: midway between top and bottom.
* `viewport.width (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Width of the viewport.
* `viewport.height (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Height of the viewport.

Example: "The cookie disclaimer stretches across the bottom of the viewport."

```javascript
var viewport = frame.viewport();
disclaimer.assert({
  bottom: viewport.bottom,    // the bottom of the disclaimer is at the bottom of the viewport
  width: viewport.width       // the width of the disclaimer is the same as the width of the viewport
});
```

**Compatibility Notes:**

* Although there *is* a standard way to get the dimensions of the viewport, and we've confirmed that it works on our [tested browsers](../build/config/tested_browsers.js), it may not be supported properly by all browsers. If you use these descriptors, perform a visual check to make sure they're working as expected, and please report compatibility problems.

* In particular, the current solution for viewport dimensions only works on pages in standards mode. Specifically, they have been tested on pages using `<!DOCTYPE html>`. They do *not* work on pages without a doctype. If support for another doctype is important to you, please let us know by opening an issue.

* Mobile Safari sometimes ignores the `width` and `height` attributes on an iframe, as described in the compatibility note for [`quixote.createFrame()`](quixote.md#quixotecreateframe). This can result in viewport descriptors returning larger-than-expected values.


### Page Positions and Sizes

```
Stability: 1 - Experimental
```

Descriptors for the position and size of the page are available on [`QFrame.page()`](QFrame.md#framepage). Unlike the viewport, these descriptors include the entire page displayed in the frame, whether or not it's scrolled out of view or not, and the page is always at least as big as the viewport. By comparing element positions and sizes to page descriptors, you can make assertions about where elements are positioned on the page.

* `page.top (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The top of the page.
* `page.right (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The right side of the page.
* `page.bottom (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The bottom of the page.
* `page.left (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` The left side of the page.
* `page.center (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Horizontal center: midway between right and left.
* `page.middle (`[`PositionDescriptor`](PositionDescriptor.md)`)` Vertical middle: midway between top and bottom.
* `page.width (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Width of the page.
* `page.height (`[`SizeDescriptor`](SizeDescriptor.md)`)` Height of the page.

Example: "The sidebar extends down the right side of the page."

```javascript
var page = frame.page();
sidebar.assert({
  right: page.right,    // The right edge of the sidebar is the same as the right edge of the page 
  height: page.height   // The height of the sidebar is the same as the height of the page
});
```

**Compatibility Notes:**

* There is no standard way to get the dimensions of the page. We have implemented a solution that works on our [tested browsers](../build/config/tested_browsers.js), but it may not work on all browsers. If you use these descriptors, perform a visual check to make sure they're working as expected, and please report compatibility problems.

* In particular, the current solution for page dimensions only works on pages in standards mode. Specifically, they have been tested on pages using `<!DOCTYPE html>`. They do *not* work on pages without a doctype. If support for another doctype is important to you, please let us know by opening an issue.


### Descriptor API

All descriptors implement the following method. In most cases, you won't need to call this method directly. Instead, use [`QElement.assert()`](QElement.md) or [`QElement.diff()`](QElement.md).


#### diff()

```
Stability: 2 - Unstable
```

Compare the descriptor to an expected value, which may be another descriptor. Throws an exception if the value isn't comparable to the descriptor.

This is the same as calling [`QElement.diff()`](QElement.md), except that it operates on just one descriptor at a time.

`diff = descriptor.diff(expected)`

* `diff (string)` A human-readable description of any differences found, or an empty string if none.

* `expected (any)` The expected value.

Example: `var diff = element.top.diff(otherElement.top);`
